# RIDE - Landing page for a ride sharing webapp

This repository contains the source code and assets for a landing page developed as an academic project.
The landing page is built using Angular, Three.js, GSAP, and Bootstrap 5.
The logo design, UI/UX work (thanks Figma) & development was all done from scratch with no templates, only following a lot of tutorials xD  

You can see it for yourself at this link:
